Slides and resources for the Threat Intelligence Support Unit (TISU)

**Threat Intelligence Support Unit (TISU)**

The Threat Intelligence Support Unit is a community that was founded by members of the Arizona Cyber Threat Response Alliance (ACTRA) and Grand Canyon University (GCU) communities, with the support and sponsorship of both organizations.  The vision was to create a TLP clear community that is open to all who demonstrate a baseline level of knowledge and agree to code of conduct.  

As such, TISU consists of two aspects:
 - The TISU community that meets monthly via Zoom and collaborates over a Discord channel.
 - A free training that we deliver every semester, followed by an exam to verify baseline knowledge.

As a starting point, this repo is a staging area to share, evolve, and improve the learning content that we use when delivering the TISU training.  

Anyone is welcome to learn from or use the content, although we maintain the right to grant permission to launch a TISU chapter, and to revoke the permission to use the TISU or Threat Intelligence Support Unit name or brand. This is only so that we can preserve the brand, by ensuring our values and standards are maintained.  Also, TISU completion certificates can only be delivered by or in coordination with the TISU governing committee.   

The basic standards to deliver training using the TISU materials and name are:
 - Permission from the governing committee.
 - Adhering to and enforcing the TISU code of ethics (see slides for ethical standards).
 - Following all rules and standards outlined by the governing committee to ensure ethical and fair conduct.
 - No fees or dues can be charged for TISU content at any time, without the express and unanimous consent of the governing committee.  

--- Ethical Standards / Code of Conduct ---

The Threat Intelligence Support Unit (TISU) community will learn about security concepts that could at times be abused or misused. Threat research and analysis may at times directly or indirectly point toward malware components, tools, and testing frameworks that could be damaging if misused. Participation in this community and/or use of any tools provided or referenced implies good intent to use such knowledge and/or tools ethically to help better protect/defend, as well as an intent to follow all applicable laws and standards associated with the industry.

See also the TISU Code of Ethics in the slides provided in this repo, for additional guidance and required standards of conduct. 

Use of the materials herein imply consent with our standards and code of conduct.

A note from Mike:

This started with requests for the slides I use when teaching malware analysis for TISU, ACTRA, and GCU.  There is a lot of room for this content to grow and improve, and we welcome the feedback and contributions of others to make this a great introductory curriculum and useful community.
